## Overview  
This project focuses on building a machine learning-based recommendation system to suggest the most suitable crops and fertilizers for farmers based on soil and environmental parameters. The goal is to enhance agricultural productivity by leveraging data-driven decision-making.The Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System leverages machine learning to empower farmers with data-driven recommendations for crop selection and fertilizer application. By analyzing critical factors such as soil nutrients (NPK levels), pH value, temperature, humidity, and rainfall, the system identifies the most suitable crops to grow and fertilizers to use. The project incorporates two machine learning models: a crop recommendation model using Random Forest and a fertilizer recommendation model using Decision Trees. This initiative aims to optimize agricultural productivity, reduce resource wastage, and promote sustainable farming practices. With plans for integration into IoT-enabled systems and mobile applications, this project seeks to transform traditional agriculture into a smarter, more efficient process, ensuring better decision-making and higher yields for farmers.

2. **Fertilizer Recommendation Model**  
   - Algorithm: Decision Tree Classifier  
   - Input Features: Crop type, NPK values, pH.  
   - Output: Suggested fertilizer.  

Both models use a pipeline for preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
